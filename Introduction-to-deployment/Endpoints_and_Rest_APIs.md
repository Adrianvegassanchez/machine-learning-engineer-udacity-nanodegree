## Production Environment and the Endpoint

###Â Endpoint and REST API

Communication between the application and the model is done through the endpoint (interface), where the endpoint is an Application Programming Interface (API).

+ An easy way to think of an API, is as a set of rules that enable programs, here the application and the model, to communicate with each other.

+ REST API  architecture provides a framework for the set of rules and constraints that must adhered to for communication between programs.

+ REST API is one that uses HTTP requests and responses to enable communication between the app and the model through the endpoint (interface)
